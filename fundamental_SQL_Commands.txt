INSERT INTO (adding)
UPDATE, SET, WHERE (update)
DELETE FROM, WHERE (delete)

2.
to insert data, you would first initiate the insert by calling INSERT, followed by INTO whatever table you want to insert the data into, and all the columns that will be affected by the insert. for instance if I want to add a new product to my product table i would do the following

INSERT INTO products (id, name, price)
VALUES
(112233, ‘gaming pc’, $2499.99);
id, name, and price are the columns being affected.

to update data, you call the update command by saying UPDATE followed by the table name(products). Then you call SET followed by the column that will be updated and what the updated info is. Then you let the command know where to change it by calling WHERE followed by the condition for the placement. for example to update the price of gaming pc’s on my products table I would the following

UPDATE products SET price=1999.99 WHERE id=112233;

to delete data, you start the command by declaring DELETE followed by the word FROM and the name of the table the data will be deleted from. After that you tell the command where to delete the data by typing WHERE and then the conditional for the placement. for example, to delete gaming pc’s from my products table all together, i would do something like the following

DELETE FROM products WHERE name=‘gaming pc’;

3.
you could use things like serial numbers(integer), IPv4 addresses(network address types), and shapes(geometric types) are just some of the endless amounts of data types that can be used in tables
