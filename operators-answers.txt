(using previous cats table as examples)

LESS THAN <
-used when you want data that has a specified value less than the comparative value.
		SELECT * FROM cats
		WHERE age < 7;

GREATER THAN >
-used when you want data that has a specified value greater than the comparative value.
		SELECT * FROM cats
		WHERE age > 3;

EQUAL TO =
-used when you want data that has a specified value equal to than the comparative value.
		SELECT * FROM cats
		WHERE age = 1;

LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO <=
-used when you want data that has a specified value less than or equal to the comparative value.
		SELECT * FROM cats
		WHERE age <= 7;

GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO >=
-used when you want data that has a specified value greater than or equal to the comparative value.
		SELECT * FROM cats
		WHERE age >= 1;

NOT EQUAL TO !=
-used when you want data that has a specified value that is not equal to the comparative value.
		SELECT * FROM cats
		WHERE age != 7;

GREATER THAN OR LESS THAN <>
-used when you want data that has a specified value that is greater than or less than the comparative value.
		SELECT * FROM cats
		WHERE age <> 3;
LIKE 
-used when you want data that has anything similar to the parameters set in the LIKE statement.
		SELECT * FROM cats
		WHERE name LIKE ‘%shell%’;
		(will return data that has “shell” somewhere in it’s name)

BETWEEN
-used when you want data that has values that are between the two set points.
		SELECT * FROM cats
		WHERE age BETWEEN 1 AND 7;

IS DISTINCT FROM 
-used instead of greater than or less than if null input is a possibility.
		SELECT * FROM cats
		WHERE adoption_date IS DISTINCT FROM ’2016-03-22’;

IS NULL
-used if you want data that’s input is null to the expression.
		SELECT * FROM cats
		WHERE adoption_date IS NULL;
AND 
-used to have more than one expression for the comparative clause. All expressions must be true to get the data.
		SELECT * FROM cats
		WHERE age < 7 AND gender = ‘M’;
OR
-if you want data with multiple different criteria(doesn’t have to be all).
		SELECT * FROM cats
		WHERE age < 7 OR gender = ‘M’;
NOT
-if you want data that’s input is NOT the expression stated.
		SELECT * FROM cats
		WHERE age NOT 7;
